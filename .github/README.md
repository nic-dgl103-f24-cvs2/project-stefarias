# Project Website Plan Content - Steffany

## 1. Project Summary

Chosen Website: http://nicolecahoon.com


### Purpose of Redesign:

The website needs an update to improve clarity, visual appeal and user experience. The redesign will focus on creating a minimalist, clean and professional look.


### Key Objectives:

 - Primary Purpose: The website should effectively show Nicole's portfolio and services, creating a impression of professionalism and creativity.

 - Target Audience: The primary audience includes potential clients looking for professional and creative services.

 - Core Message and Actions: The site have to show professionalism and dedication to quality, encouraging users to explore her portfolio and reach out for consultations.

### Current Site Limitations:

The current site has limitations in terms of accessibilit and design consistency. The visual style lacks the calm, modern feel and the content could be better organized to enhance user engagement and experience.


## 2. Look and Feel

### Mood:

The website will convey a calm, minimalist, clean, and professional atmosphere. It should feel welcoming and easy to navigate, ensuring that visitors find what they need.


### Inspiration:

Camber Coffee - https://cambercoffee.com: This site is a great example of minimalist design with a focus on visual clarity and space.

Café Brio - https://cafebrio.com/#italian-inspired: The calm, neutral palette and organized layout here create a professional yet approachable aesthetic.


### Colors 

Colors: Black, white and grey.


### Images:

I will use the logo and images from Nicole's original site, but maybe I'll add some other images to make the site more dynamic and visually appealing.


### Fonts:

Roboto and Ubuntu
